# The vision behind the project

One of my main gripes with modern day technology is the way it seeks to trivialize social interactions. Modern social media platforms reduce human interaction to a single post in a stream of content, disincentivising human connection. In the current technological landscape we are not often challenged to think about our selves relative to others. My vision for the future is a world where technology serves as a tool to form human connection rather than a hindrance.
