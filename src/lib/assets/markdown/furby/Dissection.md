# Dissecting the Furby

## Removing the skin

The electronic parts of a furby is hidden underneath a layer of fabric.
In order to get the the PCB's i had to remove it from the casing.

The skin is sheathed over the furby and stitched to the battery case and to the ears.
Removal of the battery casing was accomplished with a simple knife. Pulling up the skin reveals it contains a fluffy sensor for detecting tickles and hugs. This sensor is attached to the PCB by a little red wire and must be detached before continuing the removal.

After this the biggest hindrance are the ears. The stitches could be using a simple knife, but the skin cannot be removed before removal of the ear, as the accommodating holes in the skin are smaller than the top part.

The ear is attached to the motors by a layer of hot glue. I feared a hot air gun would melt the ears, and since I wanted to keep the furby as in-tact as possible, I had to find a better way.

Each ear was removed using a different method:

### Method 1: Chisel and hammer

The chisel and hammer method here performed by Damien, worked by chiseling between the plastic of the gear and the ear. This method worked eventually but took too long and had a high risk of damaging the ear. Therefore we decided to go with method 2.

### Method 2: Actual surgery tools

Eline's boyfriend and my good friend Jelle Willems arrived to the maker-space to check in. He just came back from his day-job as a middle-school biology teacher, and was carrying surgery tools with him. He offered to remove the ears using his surgery tools and expertise. He was able to perform a clean cut between the ear and the adhesive.

### Result

Eventualy the complete skin was removed, and I had full access to the internals.
