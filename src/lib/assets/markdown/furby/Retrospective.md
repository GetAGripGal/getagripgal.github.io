# Retrospective

## Final status

In the end I was not able to reach the definition of done. The functionality was there in separate parts but has not come together to a cohesive product.
This is the result of several factors:

### Lack of documentation

The 2012 furby model is not well documented on the internet and has a surprisingly small hacking community. Therefore most of my project was spent on exploration of the furby hardware. This however could have been fixed with a more structured approach to design.

### Lack of structure

One thing I regret not doing from the start was planning out my course of action. This means I only had a vague idea of how I would be spending my time. I ended up mostly dissecting the furby and fiddling with internals, and sometimes stopping to work on the software demos. This made it unclear how much time I had left and how long it would take.

## Going forward

As I am now moving forward and moving on with the duo project, i am planning on doing several things differently:

### Make a plan

I wish to spend time with my partner and make a plan for the project. I wish to have a clear vision of the end result and to know how far we are.

### Set out the project requirements

I wish to plan out what the project needs in case of features and design. This will allow us to have a clear vision going forward
