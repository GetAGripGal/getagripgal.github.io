# The vision behind the project

I have always had a fascination with early days of computing technology.
Old devices, machines, display's, things often considered 'retro'. There was always a captivating aspect to them I couldn't quite grasp.

As a 2000's kid, I had never lived in the era's were these machines were in their prime. My computing experience was filled with all the luxury Windows Vista and it's fancy widgets and GPU rendered desktop could offer me. My parents were early adopters of the iPad and hear people try and convince the world it would be the next big thing. Y2K was but an inside joke for those old enough to be in the know. I harbor no nostalgia or rose-tinted glasses for these relics of a kinder past. I see them for what they are, a stepping stone to where we are today. I can clearly see the fact that these machines are less good at their tasks than anything I can get for cheap at any electronic retailer.

Yet I love these things. They are a reminder of a time where technology was smaller, more comprehensible, and more helpful than it is today. And I am not the only one. Many communities have been formed around the preservation and appriciation of these older technologies. The resurgence of analog technologies like film and vinyl records shows a clear interest in these technologies from even the younger generations like millennial and generation z.

## Analog in modern culture

In his blog post "The Future of Analog: Exploring the Resurgence of Retro Technology", Ciaran Connoly talks about the implications of these trends.

`"This resurgence goes beyond mere nostalgia; it signifies a cultural shift where vintage values and aesthetics are appreciated anew in the face of an overwhelmingly digital world. These analog devices stand out for their unique sensory experiences and the distinct skills required to operate them. Moreover, they represent a bridge between generations, where older analog formats are being rediscovered and treasured by the youth of today. From the dedicated shelves for vinyl in music shops to the revival of film photography in social media, the proof of analogâ€™s lasting charm is undeniable." - Ciaran Connolly`

Ciaran is however mostly interested in the practical differences between these technologies. He mentions vinyls ability to create warmer sound, films aesthetic qualities that cannot authentically be replicated, and the experience of operating these devices. Whilst these are certainly a big part of the reason I personally enjoy these things, I think it misses the core reason these technologies resonate with so many people. Modern technologies that aim to replicate these effects, whilst a great novelty, cannot get to the root of this nostalgia itch. The user experience with these modern machine is plagued with a sense of artifice.

Today the public perspective of technology is much more decisive. What started as a collective sense of wonder for what these miracle machines could do, has turned into a disdain for the constant application of it in our lives. Technology fatigue is an ever growing phenomenon, people are tired of constantly sitting behind machines, being bombarded by social media, the ads, the notifications from out news feeds. More and more it seems like people are trying to escape from technology than they are seeking it. More and more the systems and algorithms guiding our lives are designed to take our attention away from us, rather than help us.

These technologies, while often rudimentary, are a reminder of a kinder past. Before the .com boom changed public perception of these technologies forever.
Something you can use and put back down whenever you need them. Their slow and inefficient nature lend them to a certain patience, it forces the user experience to be one of conscious engagement and effort.

## Patience and Engagement

When confronted with these older technologies, one tends the notice the lacking performance of these apperati. Any user knows the struggle of opening up back up an old windows XP laptop in order to get some old files off it you never thought you'd need again. While a lot of this can of course be due to hardware degradation in its old age, there is no denying these machines were much slower to use than back in the day.

It was very surprising to me then, that when using these old devices, I had a lot more patience with these older devices than I have with modern day equivalents. Whether it's operating a desktop pc with windows 98, or operating a old digital camera; they manage to keep me engaged with what I'm doing. Something about the rudimentary UI/UX keeps me engaged and gets me to pay more attention to what I am doing. It is for this reason that I customized my linux desktop to look like windows 98. 

Whilst one could blame this on my ADHD fueled brain, I think it has more to do with the modern approach to designing tech. Modern websites are designed to be flashy and keep your attention, but also to keep you moving on to the next thing. Modern social media platforms are designed to keep you moving from post to post in order to maximize the amount of ads you see. News sites are made to keep you looking at new articles and move on to the next page. The goal of these sites is to disincentivize real engagement, keeping you moving along as much as possible.

## The goal of our project
It is with this in mind that me and my fellow student Ashley Verburg, set our goal for our project. To create an online social media platform that encourages engagement, and causes leaves the user pondering it's contents. A way to leave people with a better appreciation for the stuff they come across, and to get people to ponder the things they put out into the world.
